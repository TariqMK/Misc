## README

The scripts within this folder are aimed for use with Kindle's 'My Clippings.txt' file, where book highlights for documents reside.

Most if not all of the code here has been written in Python using AI, but I am sure they can help anyone who wishes for more granular control over their highlights regardless.

Details for each individual script and their current status are as below.

## 00_MyClippings_to_Individual_Files.py

- This script separates highlights into files on a per book basis
- It works best for files from recent years (2020 onwards, since older files/firmware versions did things a little differently with their syntax), but older versions may work mostly well too
