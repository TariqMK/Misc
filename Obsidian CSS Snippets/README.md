This folder contains useful CSS Snippets that I use for my Obsidian Vaults.

My philosophy using Obsidian is to use it in as vanilla a configuration as possible, resulting in me using only one plugin and the default theme. This is to ensure that my actual writing within Obsidian remains as useful and accessible with the program or without it.

I have however, utilised some cosmetic features of CSS to make my Vault nicer to work with, and I have collected them in this folder in the hopes that they serve as useful to someone else.

Note that I have collected these snippets from others, patched bits together using ChatGPT or have simply collected them from various sites online. Credit will be given where due.
